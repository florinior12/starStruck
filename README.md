Program created in order to be accepted into DevAcademy.
The task was to create a program able to manage a Cafe, by keeping track of products, customers, transactions and coupons.
I have to decided to write it in Java, since it was the programming language I knew best.
Also, I have decided to make my program able to communicate to a MySQL database, something I have never did before and used no frameworks, just the jdbc connector.
I have used the Data Access Object design pattern.
